The first thing you learn leading a 24/7 operation is that the facility doesn't care about your schedule. Equipment doesn't fail between 9 and 5. Problems don't wait for the day shift. And your team — the people doing the actual work — is watching you whether you're there or not.

That last part took me a while to fully understand.

## The Visibility Problem

When you lead rotating shifts, you can't be everywhere. You have people working midnights who you might only see in person twice a week. You have technicians on afternoons who operate almost entirely on what the day shift hands them at changeover.

Early in my career I made the mistake most leaders make: I was present and engaged during day shift, and I managed nights and afternoons mostly through work orders and text messages. I told myself the systems were good enough to carry it.

They weren't.

What I found — after enough callbacks at 2 AM and enough conversations where night shift technicians said "we didn't know you wanted us to handle it that way" — is that presence is not the same as leadership. You can be physically absent and still set the tone. You can also be physically present and completely disconnected.

## What Consistency Actually Means

Consistency, in a shift environment, is not about being in the same place every day. It's about being the same leader regardless of who's watching.

That means your standards don't change based on whether it's day shift or midnights. Your expectations around documentation, around equipment care, around how a job site gets left — those have to be identical across every shift, because your people will find every gap between what you say and what you actually enforce.

It means your communication is the same quality whether you're sending a message at 10 AM or responding to a problem at 11 PM. Tone matters. Urgency matters. If you only engage with nights when something goes wrong, you've taught them that the only way to get your attention is to have a problem.

## The Handoff Is Everything

In a rotating shift operation, the shift changeover is where culture either holds or falls apart. That 15-minute window between shifts is where information gets transferred — or doesn't. Where the outgoing crew either sets the incoming crew up for success or hands them a minefield.

I spent years refining our changeover process. Not just the paperwork — the actual conversation between technicians. The questions that needed to be asked. The things that needed to be flagged even if they weren't urgent yet.

The best shift leaders I've seen treat handoff as a form of respect. You're not just transferring information. You're telling the next person: I know your shift matters as much as mine, and I'm going to set you up to succeed.

## What It Taught Me About Leadership Generally

Leading shift workers forced me to get very precise about what I actually expected versus what I assumed people understood. Assumed expectations don't survive shift changes. They get lost in translation, interpreted differently by different supervisors, and eventually become inconsistent practices that nobody can fully explain.

If you can't write it down clearly enough that a technician coming in on midnights can execute it correctly without you there — it's not a standard, it's a preference.

That discipline — the work of making your expectations explicit, documented, and enforceable — carries into every leadership role I've had since. The facility runs at night the way you build it to run during the day.
