The best test of a maintenance culture isn't what happens when leadership is watching. It's what happens on a Saturday night when a machine goes down, the supervisor is unreachable, and a technician has to make a call alone.

Does he take the shortcut because no one will know? Or does he do it right because that's just how things are done here?

That question — answered consistently, across every shift, across every technician, over years — is your maintenance culture.

## Culture Is Not What You Post on the Wall

Every facility I've visited has some version of the same safety and quality posters in the break room. Core values on a laminated card. A mission statement that nobody can recite.

None of that is culture. Culture is the collection of behaviors that actually happen, day after day, when the stated values are inconvenient. It's what gets tolerated. What gets rewarded. What gets modeled by the people with authority.

If you preach equipment care but pressure techs to skip steps when production is behind, you have a production culture with maintenance theater on top. People see through it immediately. They adjust their behavior to the real incentives, not the stated ones.

## The Leader's Role Is Mostly Modeling

I've tried most of the standard approaches to building culture: training programs, revised procedures, accountability systems, incentive structures. They all help at the margin. None of them are the primary driver.

The primary driver is what the leader does when it costs something.

When you stop a job because the lockout procedure wasn't followed — even when it means missing a production target — that lands. When you publicly recognize a technician who flagged a developing problem before it became a failure — even a small one — that lands. When you admit a decision you made contributed to a failure instead of finding someone else to hold accountable — that lands hard.

Culture is built in those moments. Not in the training room.

## Build the Standard, Then Defend It

Maintenance culture requires standards that are actually standard — meaning they don't flex based on who's asking or how much pressure is coming from production.

Building the standard is the easier part. Writing the procedure, creating the checklist, documenting the expectation — that's work, but it's straightforward work. The harder part is defending it consistently over time.

Every time you allow an exception without examining whether the exception should become the new standard, you've weakened the standard. Every time a technician sees a supervisor wave off a step because they're in a hurry, the implicit message is: the standard is a suggestion.

The way to defend a standard is to take violations seriously even when they seem minor, and to be willing to explain why the standard exists — not just enforce it, but teach it. A technician who understands why a procedure is written the way it is will maintain it better under pressure than one who's just following a rule.

## Hire for Attitude, Train for Skill

The biggest culture decisions are hiring decisions. Every person you bring into a maintenance team either reinforces the culture you're trying to build or erodes it.

Technical skills can be taught. The disposition to care — to actually give a damn whether a machine is in good condition, whether the work was done right, whether the next shift is set up for success — that's much harder to develop in someone who doesn't bring it.

In interviews, I ask about the last time something went wrong on a job and what the candidate did about it. I ask what their previous workspace looked like at the end of a shift. I ask what they do when they find a problem that's not on their work order.

The answers tell me more than any certification.

## Think About What You're Leaving Behind

The measure of a maintenance leader isn't the uptime numbers during their tenure. It's the state of the equipment and the capability of the team when they leave.

Have you built something that runs on its own principles, or something that runs on your presence? If you left tomorrow, would the culture hold — or would it slowly drift back toward whatever was there before you arrived?

That's the real question. And answering it honestly requires thinking less about what you've accomplished and more about what you've built into the people and systems around you.

The best leaders I've seen in this business are the ones who made themselves, eventually, unnecessary. Not because they checked out, but because they built teams that didn't need them to be there for things to go right.

That's the goal. Everything else is just maintenance.
