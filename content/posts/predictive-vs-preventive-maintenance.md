Every maintenance team I've ever worked with runs some version of a preventive maintenance schedule. PMs are comfortable. They're predictable. You know when the work is coming, you can plan labor around it, and you can point to a calendar and say "we did our job."

But comfortable isn't always right.

## The Core Difference

**Preventive maintenance** is time-based. You change the oil every 3 months, replace the filter every 500 hours, rebuild the pump every year — regardless of actual condition. It's the manufacturer's recommendation turned into a recurring work order.

**Predictive maintenance** is condition-based. You monitor the equipment — vibration, temperature, oil analysis, ultrasound — and you intervene when the data tells you something is changing. Not before, not after.

The difference sounds simple. The implications aren't.

## When Preventive Fails You

Preventive schedules are built on averages. The manufacturer tested their equipment under controlled conditions and recommended intervals based on typical use. Your facility is not typical.

I've seen bearings fail three weeks after a scheduled replacement because the new bearing was installed incorrectly. I've seen motors run 40% beyond their PM interval because the operating conditions in that facility were unusually clean and cool. Averages cut both ways.

The bigger problem is what happens when you open equipment up on a schedule: you introduce risk. Every time a technician touches a machine, there's a chance of an induced failure — a seal not seated right, a connection not torqued properly, contamination introduced during reassembly. PM-induced failures are real, and they're more common than most teams admit.

## The Case for Predictive

Predictive maintenance works best when:

- The equipment is critical (failure = production stoppage or safety risk)
- Failure modes develop gradually over time (not sudden, random failures)
- You have or can install sensors to monitor condition
- Your team has the skills to interpret the data

Vibration analysis on rotating equipment is the most common entry point. A bearing starting to fail will show up in a vibration signature weeks before it actually fails. That's your window — not the calendar.

## Selling It Upward

The hardest part of moving toward predictive isn't the technology. It's the conversation with leadership.

Here's the framing that works: predictive maintenance doesn't replace your PM program. It makes it smarter. You're not proposing to stop doing maintenance — you're proposing to do it at the right time instead of an arbitrary time.

Come with data. Pull your last 12 months of work orders. Find every PM job where you replaced a part that showed no signs of wear. Calculate what that labor and material cost you. That's your baseline for what you're currently spending on unnecessary maintenance.

Then find your last three unplanned failures. Calculate the downtime cost, the emergency parts cost, the overtime. That's what you're trying to prevent.

The ROI argument writes itself.

## Where to Start

Don't try to convert your entire PM program at once. Pick one critical asset — ideally one with a history of either premature PM replacements or unexpected failures — and pilot a predictive approach on it.

Run both in parallel for six months. Track the data. Let the results make the argument.

The goal isn't to eliminate preventive maintenance. It's to earn the right to be more precise about when and why you intervene. That precision is what separates a reactive maintenance culture from a proactive one.

And that difference shows up directly on your downtime numbers.
